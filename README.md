# Yet Another Neural Network

A simple feed forward neural network written in Java. Works very well on the classic MNIST dataset for recognizing handwritten numbers from images. Does not work very well for predicting Bitcoin prices. 

There are multiple activation functions and matrix multiplication methods for experimenting.

To run the program use Java 14 or greater and start from the main class.
